This project implements a two-phase Rubik’s Cube solver in Java (heavily inspired by Kociemba), capable of solving any valid 3×3×3 cube state.
It reads a 9×12 rubiks cube scramble file, converts it into a cubie-based representation, initializes pruning tables, and computes an optimal or near-optimal solution.
